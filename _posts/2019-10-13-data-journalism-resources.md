title: Data Journalism Resources
---

A friend asked me for some resources in helping a team developing some data journalism capabilities. Here are the things I've pulled together. It's not comprehensive by all means but it's a start.

### Workflow

- [Resources and training material from the NYT](https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-helped-our-reporters-learn-to-love-spreadsheets-adc43a93b919)

- [The Guardian's workflow from 2011](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/apr/07/data-journalism-workflow)

- [SciDev.net's workflow](https://www.scidev.net/global/journalism/practical-guide/data-journalism-how-to-find-stories-in-numbers.html)

- [How to set up a newsroom for a collaborative data project from  Propublica](https://www.propublica.org/nerds/collaborative-data-journalism-guide)

### General Resources

- [DataJournalism.com](http://DataJournalism.com) is a massive resource from EJC and Google News, especially the handbook. Lots of advice from experience and articles

- Paul Bradshaw's [Data Journalism](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism) and [Specialist Investigative Journalism](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7369-Specialist-Investigative-Journalism) modules are part of the MA in Data Journalism and the latter is an optional module on the MA in Multiplatform and Mobile Journalism at Birmingham City University. The modules have lots of links to readings, examples and exercises.
