# Resources for getting started in data vis



- DWP data vis course 
[dataviztraining.dwpdata.info/index.html](https://t.co/LqKm5eJUaJ) 
Very good summary of data vis, we've recently nicked some bits from this for our own course

- ONS Style guide 
[style.ons.gov.uk/category/data-…](https://t.co/YuFet37hLg)
Good for principles to base stuff off.

- Data wrapper blog
[blog.datawrapper.de/category/thoug…](https://t.co/8xeDDF7w7p)
Excellent blog talking about the decisions that go on behind making data visualisations.

-- Books
- List of recommended books

- Even longer list

Tufte is considered the Daddy of data vis although his stuff is getting a
 bit old now. Alberto Cairo is the new Daddy. If I would recommend 
someone for  beginners it would be him. He runs a online course on [journalismcourses.org](https://t.co/JRdYwTMt2A) if they can stretch to that. 

He's got a recent talk that might be worth devoting some time too [youtube.com/watch?v=sLDMal…](https://t.co/pfnb4C0bOJ)

Another great resouce is Visual Vocabulary from the FT [github.com/ft-interactive…](https://t.co/QSW16PVoCJ) and the related article series The Chart Doctor [ft.com/chart-doctor](https://t.co/kiaEJ7aXJ7).

Visual vocab is a reference guide on different ways to represent data 
plus a bit of background on why that particular way suits that data. 

Chart Doctor articles talk about issues creating visualisations and how 
people approach them and reason why they make certain design decisions.
