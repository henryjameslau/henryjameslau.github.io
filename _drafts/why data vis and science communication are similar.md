I come from a science communication background and there are many parallels between science and statistics. It's complicated (there's a barrier to understanding it). In the 1980s, it was thought that we just needed to talk about science more and people would understand. The deficit model. This didn't work. Public trust declined. See the BSE crisis. 

In 2000, the House of Lords Science and Technology committee launched the science and society inquiry. They found that this deficit model wasn't working and suggested changing to a dialogue model. Equal partnerships and giving executive power to the public. This has been implemented to various degrees and now appears as RRI (reponsible research and innovation).
