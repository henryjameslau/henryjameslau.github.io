title: What the ONS digital content team does
---

This builds on the previous post that explained about our team and how we work internally. This post covers more about our work externally and is in part a way to advertise an upcoming vacancy in our team.

The Office for National Statistics (ONS) sits on a wealth of data and there are many stories in the data. With the help of the analysts and statisticians within the organisation. We help tell the stories that mean the most to people; the stories of public interest, policy relevance and worthy of being in the news. 

The journalists in our team change the way we write and talk about statistics to make it more understandable. The visualisation team (my team) work in present the data visually take make the most sense to the user. This could be a map, an interactive chart, a calculator or just a plain chart with beautifully crafted annotations.

The ONS website is not a lunch time read. Our stories are promoted by our media relations and external stakeholder teams and syndication from news outlets is our way of getting our message out a wide audience.  They can add additional voices for their story. All our interactives are embeddable for others to use in their sites. This has implications for our interactives. Long scrolly-telling is not feasibly as you can't tell scroll depth and also our styles need to not clash with different parents sites. 

Telling these stories. We're a public body, serving the public and paid for by taxpayers. By getting these stories and data in front of people, in a way they can understand, people can have a more meaningful on conversations.
