title: My first 4 months at the ONS
---

##From Big Smoke to Little Town

I moved from my job in Parliament to working for the ONS in August last year. Since it's the new year, he's my thoughts on the first 4 months. 

###Back to writing

It's been nice to get back to writing articles which get published. I have been lucky to work with great editors so finesse my writing but for a while that skill hasn't been used that much until now. I've learnt I enjoy it, still not great at it and lots to learn from other people. 

###Project plate spinning

Due to the long time scale involved in some of the projects we're working on, we're often juggling multiple projects at any one time. Much more than I've done in the past. It's hard and a new skill to move to each project often to keep that plate spinning but something I hope to improve. 

###D3 Wizard

Turns out I'm pretty good at d3.js. All those weekends working on data visualisations projects for Around the World in 80 Doughs have taught me quite a lot. Now the thing for us to work on is to figure out the best way to share this knowledge in the team so everyone can be D3 wizards.

###Reassuring Bureaucracy  

In many ways the ONS and Parliament are very similar. At Parliament there are teams of researchers working in the library answering questions from Parliamentarians and producing briefings for debates. At the ONS, there are teams of analysts crunching data and models and producing reports. There's very little leeway to when these people are producing reports to a deadline. It's hard to get people to shift their viewpoint from producing these detail reports that contain everything to a more streamlined version suitable for the public. We have to work with them as they are the experts and rightly so, they know the data better than anyone else. They need to be happy and sign off the work. All these steps to protect reputation is important especially in a world of dangerous.



There's lots to celebrate too. I've published pieces I'm proud of in collaboration with other team members. I've started  being a manager and trying to be a good one. But still much more to learn and more to celebrate.
