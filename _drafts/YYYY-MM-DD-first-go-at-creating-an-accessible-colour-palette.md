title: First attempt at creating an accessible colour palette
---

Working with colleagues I worked on creating a set of colour palettes that could be used for data visualisations. Almost every organisation has brand colours so how can you make a palette of colours for data visualisation from that. 

MATHS! That's how.

## Categorical colours from a single hue

After reading around the subject a lot, I came across a cube-helix scale. This spirals through an RGB cube and seems great at creating colours scales that go from dark to light and also tranverse colours in the middle to create extra distance between colours. This is partly because the path is spirally so taking a longer path. Very clever stuff.
