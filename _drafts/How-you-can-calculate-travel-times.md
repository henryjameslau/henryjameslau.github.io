Last year we published an article analysing the commuting patterns between men and women. [We found women are more likely than men to leave their job over a long commute.](https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/articles/thecommutinggapwomenaremorelikelythanmentoleavetheirjoboveralongcommute/2019-09-04) 

The initial analysis used distance in a straight line between the home and work postcode of respondents of the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE). We wanted to use travel time as that better reflected what people actually did and took into account that some trip might be faster or slower depending on road networks or public transport options. 

Here are instructions on how you can do similar travel time analysis

### Set up Open Trip Planner

First you will need to download some timetables and routes for trains, buses and coaches. The [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/) has created some [cleaned sample feeds](https://github.com/datasciencecampus/graphite#sample-gtfs-data) from March 2019. 

The second thing is an Open Street Map excerpt for the road network. You can get regions and countries from [geofabrik](https://download.geofabrik.de/).







Many thanks to [Michael Hodge](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/author/michael-hodge/) from the [Data Science Campus](https://datasciencecampus.ons.gov.uk/) who helped me get up and running with OTP.  

The Data Science Campus had been working on a tool that used [Open Trip Planner](http://docs.opentripplanner.org/en/latest/) (OTP) to analyse travel times. I talked to Michael Hodge from the Data Science Campus and he helped me get set up on running the Open Trip Planner with bus, trains
