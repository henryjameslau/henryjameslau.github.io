The Use of Narrative in Data Visualisation



There are many different sides to data visualisation. Lisa Charlotte Rost did a very good talk about [the reasons why we visualize data](https://lisacharlotterost.de/2017/03/10/why-do-we-visualize-data/). She broke the goals of data visualisation into three categories

1. Attention & Beauty
2. Understanding
3. Implication

In her talk, she writes about the goals of Data Journalism being focused on understanding and explaining, but also attracting readers.

When thinking about explaining people often think about narrative. There's a lot we know about how narrative helps people understand information, especially from the field of Science Communication (which was my master's degree)
