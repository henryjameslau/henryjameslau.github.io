[The FT have organised chart types by relationship of data](https://github.com/ft-interactive/chart-doctor/tree/master/visual-vocabulary) as this is closest to narrative. On our website we have guidance on what makes a good data viz and common mistakes.

1. Call to truth. One way of encoding is preferred to another because readers are able to tell the underlying data values easier.
2. Fallacy of time. You may be showing effect that only appear in certain time periods and looking shorter or longer and the effect may disappear.
3. Readability. Making this faster to read, because of how the brain sees things or is trying to read things.
4. Aesthetics. Wanting to making things look good at the detriment of readability or truth.
5. Colour. Understand human physiology and the way the eye does not see colour linearly like computers calculate colour.
6. Narrative. Choosing a visualisation type that does well to explain the relationships in the data and the context.
7. Relationships/relatives. Is this data a target, or is it relative to itself, other data sets. 
8. Relevant data. Can the data itself show some light on the question you are trying to answer?
