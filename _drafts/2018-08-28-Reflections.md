title: Reflections on one year at the ONS
---

It's been just over one year since I joined the Office for National Statistics to work in the data visualisation team. As with most jobs it took a while to find my feet, but now I no longer stumble when I explain my job. I help communicate the information and data the ONS collects about the UK economy and society to everyone in a way that's more understandable. Moving away from long reports and excel sheets, our [multidisclipinary teams](http://henrylau.co.uk/2018/01/11/The-digital-content-team/) use plain English and visuals to improve communication of ONS data. Our hope is that by improving how we talk about stats, it will raise the level of debate in society about the important issues. 

It felt a bit scary seemingly jumping fields, but there is a lot of overlap with my previous roles in user research, parliament communications, public engagement and science communication. You need to know your audience, work to get yourself where they are, and give them a meaningful engagement. Plus now I'm doing more programming and more maths. 

###  From amateur to profession

I started doing interactive data visualisations as a bit of a hobby. I set myself [projects](https://aroundtheworldin80doughs.tumblr.com/index) learn to code with d3.js. I listened to other people blogging about issues in data vis for example, using of colour wisely or the best way to represent data truthfully.

But now I'm a practitioner I've learnt so much more. I've improved my coding. I understand more technologies. I am more familiar with principles of data vis so I can talk about why things should be a certain way. 

I've done more writing

I'm learning how to run projects

Also learning how to be a manager (and think I'll never stop learning), but it's rewarding to see someone flourish and grow. 

### What's coming up next?

On a personal level, I want to use some of my user research skills to feed into the evidence behind what we do. Attending conferences is great, but also I'd like to do some user researcher. The team worked on a prototype website called visual.ons. This site has been archived and integrated into the ONS website. We're not working through expanding the things we've learnt from doing visual out to the wider business. This is not going to be an easy task as it involved changing people's minds and in some ways educating people about the principles we follow.

When sitting down to write this blog post, I realised that although I was learning through my visualtion experiments, I learnt much faster with other people around me. So that's the goal for next. How to take the learnings we've done out to wider government.

So what do you say, let's create a bigger community.
