title: A guide to running workshops to find stories in data
---

Often a project starts with a topic area or a dataset. It's expected that there are some stories to be found. How does one get started? Is there a way of making this quicker and easier.

We have been experimenting with running sprints to generate stories and ideas that are submitted to our commission group. Here's a rough guide.

### Step 1 - Identify datasets and their owners

- Identify which datasets might be able to tell you something about your issue. Identify who knows these datasets in-depth and could help clarify the limitations of the data.

### Step 2 - Find a time in the diaries for a meeting

- Book a chunk of time in the data owners diaries for a meeting. Try and get it face-to-face if possible. You want people who are interested and invested. 

### Step 3 - Research what is already out there on the issue

- Find out what other people have done on the issue and think about what new information you could add. Try to think in single questions. Why would answering these questions be interesting/helpful?

### Step 4 - Brainstorm questions

- Bring a few people together to help think of more lines of investigations and more questions that would be interesting to answer. People will bring different interests and opinions to the table. 

### Step 5 - Run the session

- You've gather your data owners, you have a list of questions. Now it's time to see whether your questions can be answered by the dataset, and maybe even if the analysis on the data shows anything interesting. Some questions might be out of scope of the dataset. 

Step 4 and 5 can be run concurrently if you want, as often the people who know the data also have good knowledge of the issues. Harness their knowledge but guide it by looking at topicality, news value and personal interest. 

### Step 6 - Recluster the questions

Your questions may have already had some grouping. Some groupings might have come out from thinking about what each data source. At this point it might be worth resorting the questions. A card sort exercise works really well here, so get the post-it notes out. Some questions might be more interesting than other and it could help you prioritise what you'd want to talk about.

Depending on where you are with your data, you may have to run some analysis to really find if there's really a story in the data. From here on in, it's should be a case of working to tell the story of what's going on with words and visuals.
