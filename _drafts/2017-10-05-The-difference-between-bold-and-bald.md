# The difference between bold and bald   

Do you get those questions that you wish you knew someone who could answer them? For me I always get those with linguistics. Luckily I know a linguist. In fact someone with a PhD in linguistics, Dr Sarah Foxen. 

And one office conserversation arguing over the pronounciation between brooch and broach turned into a mini linguistics study. 

I asked Google to read them [brooch](http://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20160317/brooch--_gb_1.mp3) and [broach](http://ssl.gstatic.com/dictionary/static/sounds/20160317/broach--_gb_1.mp3). I heard a difference. Sarah didn't. So we put the sounds through a spectrographic analysis tool used by linguists called [praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/). 

Here's the results. 
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Having a fun morning debating the difference between broach and brooch with <a href="https://twitter.com/SarahFoxen?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SarahFoxen</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/linguistics?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#linguistics</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AskALinguist?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#AskALinguist</a> <a href="https://t.co/u3U7tnRbY9">pic.twitter.com/u3U7tnRbY9</a></p>&mdash; Henry Lau (@henryjameslau) <a href="https://twitter.com/henryjameslau/status/889769220057313280?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

There's a slight difference between the images. So there's a difference in sound. But the sound heard by the ears and interpreted by the brain is subjective. 

Then this happened
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">haha - I need a blog on this. Bold and bald always gets me</p>&mdash; Jack Craig (@jackcraig) <a href="https://twitter.com/jackcraig/status/889771804914581504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 25, 2017</a></blockquote>

Sarah also wondered about bowled. So we decided to do a little experiment. 

## The tests

We devised two tests. One to see if people can tell the difference in the words Jack says. This involved 3 b words (bold, bald, bowled) and 5 filler words. The task was to listen to the 8 words and write down what you thought the word that jack said was. 

Here's the test.

The second test aimed to see if there was a difference in the way people say and hear the three b words. We recorded 7 people with different accents read our set text without telling them about the experiment. The audio was cut to isolate the 3 different b words. For the test, the order of the speaker and the b words were randomised. You then had to listen to the word and choose out of the 3 option what word you heard.

### Our text

This is the text we ended up using. Trying to put the words of interest at the end of sentences, and also including words with similar endings for comparison. 

Be careful with the kettle, the hot water might **scald ** you.
I think cheese is very nice on crackers
It was a **bold** statement the chancellor made.
I’m going to Whittards to buy some ground coffee.
His ring was made of **gold**.
Ten times twelve is one hundred and twenty.
My dad can’t cope with the fact he’s going **bald**.
There are forty-two elephants in Berlin
When I saw Phil Tuffnel at Lords he **bowled** a yorker

## Analysis
### Test 1
Here's what people thought was being said versus what Jack said.

Word 1 - Crackers

Word 2 - Forty

Word 3 - Bowled

Word 4 - Made

Word 5 - Bold

Word 6 - Fact

Word 7 - Bald

Word 8 - Coffee

## Test 2
We had 7 people participate in the test. The scores ranged from 4 - 13. This is even better than when I did the test myself and I had been hearing the words all the time as I edited them. It's worth pointing out that chance gives you a score of 7 as you have 21 questions and a 1 in 3 chance of picking the correct answer. 

We also asked if people were musical to see if that improved. 3 people self identified as musical and averaged 9 compared to the 4 that identified as non musical who scored 7. Small sample size I know. 

We can also add up the total correct scores for each speaker to see who spoke the most clearly.

There was one speaker who had the highest number of correct responses with 11, out of a possible 21. 
Two speakers joint at 10. Interestingly the speakers who were the most clear had the strongest accents. Jack's words scored 2nd lowest in terms of clarity. 

So there you have it, Jack probably doesn't say bold or bold in a very distinctive way, but most people don't can't tell the difference the way many people say those words.
